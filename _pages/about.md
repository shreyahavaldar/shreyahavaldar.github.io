Hello!! I'm Shreya, a third year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I currently work with [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) and the [World Well Being Project](https://wwbp.org/). I am advised by [Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and [Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/). 

Previously, I attended the University of Southern California (Fight On!!) where I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. During my time at USC, I worked with Morteza Dehghani at the [Morality and Language Lab](https://www.mola-lab.org/) (formerly the Computational Social Science Lab).

I specialize in culturally-aware multilingual NLP, analyzing how culture influences linguistic styles (emotion, politeness, etc.), creating explanation methods to derive cultural insight from black-box models, and mitigating Anglocentric bias in modern LMs. My research is supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

I am currently working on: (1) Analyzing how Twitter reflects the differences in individualism/collectivism across the United States and globally, and (2) Quantifying how translation fails to preserve components of liguistic style.

Outside of academia, I like to cook, run, and ask strangers if I can pet their dogs. Please reach out if you want to chat about my research, the NSF GRFP, or the PhD application process!
