Hello!! I'm Shreya, a second year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I currently work with [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) and the [World Well Being Project](https://wwbp.org/). I am advised by [Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/) and [Eric Wong](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~exwong/). 

Previously, I attended the University of Southern California (Fight On!!) where I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. During my time at USC, I worked with Morteza Dehghani at the [Morality and Language Lab](https://www.mola-lab.org/) (formerly the Computational Social Science Lab).

My work is focused on explainability within multilingual NLP and understanding how cultural dimensions are reflected in language. I am interested in creating culturally-aware explanation methods for multilingual models as well as using large language models as a tool to empirically investigate cultural differences. My research is supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

I am currently working on: 
 - Explaining multicultural differences in politeness by analyzing conversations between Wikipedia editors from different countries
 - Investigating whether multilingual LMs reflect the cultural norms of emotional expression
 - Analyzing how Twitter reflects the differences in individualism/collectivism across the United States and globally


Outside of academia, I like to cook, run, and ask strangers if I can pet their dogs. Please reach out if you want to chat about my research, the NSF GRFP, or the PhD application process!
