Hello!! I'm Shreya, a second year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I currently work with [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) and the [World Well Being Project](https://wwbp.org/). I am advised by Professor Lyle Ungar.

Previously, I attended the University of Southern California (Fight On!!) where I received a B.S. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. During my time at USC, I worked with Professor Morteza Dehghani at the [Morality and Language Lab](https://www.mola-lab.org/) (formerly the Computational Social Science Lab).

My work is focused on multilingual NLP and investigating cultural dimensions in language. I am interested in investigating culturally-aware explanations for multilingual models as well as developing conversational agents that reflect cultural norms. 

My current work includes: 
 - Investigating how politeness differs in conversations between Wikipedia editors from different countries
 - Multilingual neural topic modeling for emotions
 - Analyzing how Twitter reflects the differences in individualism/collectivism across American counties


Outside of academia, I like to cook, run, and ask strangers if I can pet their dogs. Please reach out if you want to chat about my research, the PhD application process, or if you know where to find a good burrito in Philly!
